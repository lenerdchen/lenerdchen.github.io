				Increase the number of paying users at the end of our 7-day free trial
				experience.
			</h4>
			<p>
				From our product data, we know that users who connect to the VPN more
				frequently are more likely to convert. However, there is a steep drop in
				engagement for new users after the first day, which led to eventual
				churn.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>
					My challenge was to discover why these new users weren’t engaging with
					the VPN after their first day, and define experiments to increase the
					mean number of days connected.</strong

				Build a problem-solution hypothesis framework to structure our
				experiments.
			</h4>
			<p>
				I led interviews with 8 free trial users & surveyed 500+ more users, and
				identified the blockers that prevented them from engaging more with the
				VPN during the free trial.
			</p>
			<p>
				We discovered that many first-time, casual users needed guidance to
				understand how to use the VPN, evaluate the quality of the service, and
				how to make the most of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>I reframed these insights as problem hypotheses</strong>, and
				led brainstorming with the cross-functional team to develop solution
				ideas to tackle these user problems.

				Lo-fi concept testing to identify most effective solutions.
			</h4>
			<p>
				Partnering another designer, we built interactive prototypes that
				demonstrated our solution hypotheses. I led user testing with 8 free
				trial users, evaluating their reactions to the updated onboarding &
				first use experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				We discovered that the users had an ‘a-ha’ moment of realising the VPN’s
				value when we showed them data of how the VPN was working.
				<strong>
					We redesigned the first connection experience, and launched an A/B
					test to see if it would increase their mean days connected and
					eventual conversion.

			<span class="small">THE RESULT</span>
			<h4 class="case-title">
				Demonstrating the VPN’s performance & value increases engagement &
				retention.
			</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>
					The redesigned first connection experience led to a +3.7% increase in
					Day 8 conversion amongst free trial users.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The experiment gave us confidence that the problem hypothesis around
				users not understanding the VPN’s working & its value to their daily
				lives was worth pursuing further. We continued to experiment on other
				solution hypotheses to demonstrate the VPN’s performance & value (e.g.,
				threats blocked, connection speed).
