        Simplify the end-of-life experience to make it more empathetic & less
        effortful.
      </h4>
      <p>
        When a loved one passes away, citizens have to transact across many
        government agencies and physical touch-points to register their death,
        manage funeral & burial services, and settle their estate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          My challenge was to lead 8 government agencies to redesign the
          end-of-life experience and develop a one-stop service to guide
          citizens through this difficult time.

        Map the experience to highlight citizen pain points and back-end
        inefficiencies.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The end-of-life process was complex because government agencies were
        optimising their own parts of the process without looking at the
        experience from the citizenâ€™s perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          I led a team of 3 UX designers to interview citizens, end-of-life
          professionals, and front-line public service workers to map out the
          end-of-life service blueprint, highlighting major pain points,
          inefficiencies, and opportunity areas.

        Two-pronged approach to simplify the process and resolve issues
        up-stream.
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>
          First, we needed to make post-death administration simpler & more
          empathetic for citizens.
        </strong>
        We collected instructions & content from all 8 public agencies, re-wrote
        them as step-by-step guides, and designed a single-stop resource to walk
        citizens through this difficult time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Second, we also needed to encourage citizens to make & share plans
          with their families before death happens,
        </strong>
        so their loved ones feel confident & guided on their choices after they
        are gone. We built a vault where citizens could make healthcare,
        funerary & estate administration plans, and share them with trusted
        people to use after death.
      </p>

    <div class="case-section">
      <span class="small">THE RESULT</span>
      <h4 class="case-title">
        Building empathy for our citizens breaks down long-standing agency
        boundaries.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Through the discovery research & design sprint, we helped the public
        agencies see that each interaction caused friction & frustration for
        citizens at this difficult time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Our design principle was to build data linkages and remove extra
          touch-points wherever possible.
        </strong>
        For example, we streamlined & digitised the death registration process,
        removing the burden from the family. In the vault, we automatically
        pulled in existing end-of-life plans, providing a complete view with no
        extra action needed.
