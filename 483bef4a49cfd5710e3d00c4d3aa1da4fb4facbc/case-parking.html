      <h4>
        We receive thousands of appeals against parking fines each year.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The majority of these appeals are rejected. However, when we went out to speak to drivers, we heard many say
        the <em>opposite</em> – that the majority appeals are accepted. This was probably because many successful
        appellants share their 'success' stories, while
        those whose appeals are rejected do not go around broadcasting their 'failures'.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we spoke to the parking authorities, we realised it was not simply a problem of reducing the volume of
        appeals. We wanted to reduce the incidence of frivolous appeals, but not turn away those with legitimate
        reasons to appeal.
      </p>
      <p class="body--text-quote">
        The problem was not just reducing the volume of appeals - but increasing the accuracy of appeals. We want to
        encourage appellants with legitimate causes to proceed, while those with frivolous cases should not waste their
        time and effort.
