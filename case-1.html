      <span class="small">THE CHALLENGE</span>
      <h4 class="case-title">
        Define the product & brand differentiation between our stable of VPN
        services.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Our company recently acquired a stable of 3 VPN services. To grow these
        brands without cannibalising market share, we needed to establish
        product & brand differentiation by focusing on different user problems &
        segments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          My challenge was to discover the unmet needs of our users, define our
          user segments and product propositions</strong
        >, and align our leaders on the product strategy for each brand.

      <h4 class="case-title">
        Understand our users deeply to define jobs-to-be-done desired outcomes.
      </h4>
      <p>
        I paired with a Senior UX Researcher to interview 24 users and survey
        thousands more to understand usersâ€™ concerns, attitudes, and behaviours
        in protecting their online privacy & security.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We defined three core user personas</strong>, and used visual
        storytelling to demonstrate to product managers & brand leaders the
        scenarios of their unmet needs & problems.

        Concept testing through scenarios & stories to identify high potential
        opportunities.
      </h4>
      <p>
        I worked with 2 designers & a product manager to ideate on how we could
        potentially solve these user jobs, and develop lo-fi prototypes that
        told the story of these solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through user testing, we identified the problems & solution experiences
        that resonated with each user segment.
        <strong
          >We defined design principles and built interactive prototypes to
          showcase the product experience for each user.</strong

      <h4 class="case-title">
        Visualising the experience enables alignment and long-term buy-in.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Everyone in the company had an opinion on what we should invest in next
        & how to grow each brand. I led multiple workshops with Product,
        Engineering, Marketing & Brand leaders to share our understanding of
        users, align their opinions against market & user insights, and build
        their ideas based on the key jobs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these workshops & user testing,
        <strong
          >we defined the unique value propositions & brand positioning for the
          3 VPN brands, and identified 9 product opportunities to be further
          developed across the brands.</strong
